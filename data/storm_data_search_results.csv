With cold air in place along the surface, as a strong low pressure system moved northeast across the Great Lakes, a second low formed over the Mid-Atlantic States and moved northeast across Long Island during Sunday afternoon, January 3rd.

A light intermittent mix of sleet and freezing rain began just after midnight on Sunday. As an icy coating developed on road surfaces below freezing, some significant traffic accidents occurred across the region from midnight through 3 am.

However, as southeast winds increased, gusting from 45 to 50 mph, surface temperatures quickly rose above freezing from the immediate coast west during the night.  An intense narrow band of torrential rain developed within a large area of steady rain.  Rain fell on a frozen ground surface at rates as high as 3 inches per hour. This resulted in rapid runoff that caused widespread serious flooding of low-lying and poor drainage areas mainly from Kings County east across Central Suffolk County.  Life-threatening flash flooding occurred in a 30 block area of Springfield Gardens (Queens) where people required rescue from their flooded basement apartments.  Water rose to within 6 inches of the ceilings in several apartments.  Many locations along the Belt and Southern State Parkways, the Long Island Expressway, and Northern State Parkway were closed due to serious flooding.

High winds developed rapidly in an unstable air mass following the passage of a strong cold front across the area.  Several measured peak wind gusts were at least 58 mph.  They were responsible for causing 1 death and at least 6 injuries, as follows:  

At 9:05 am, a tree fell through a car wind shield and injured 1 person in Islip (Suffolk County).

At 9:30 am, a street sign struck and injured 2 pedestrians in Kings County (Brooklyn).

At 9:40 am, a sign struck and injured 1 person in Flatbush (Brooklyn) and a tree fell on and injured 1 person in Great Neck (Nassau County).

At 10:30 am, a sign struck a police car, which caused injury to 1 person in Patchogue (Suffolk County).

At 1:00 pm, a man was crushed by a tree while trying to remove a branch that dangled over the driveway of a house at 135 Heatherdell Road in Ardsley (Westchester County).

High winds downed many trees onto houses, cars, power lines, and streets.  In urban areas, high winds downed signs, collapsed scaffolds, and caused five partial building collapses.  They caused significant property damage and power outages.  On the Throgs Neck Bridge in Queens, 2 tractor trailers flipped with unknown additional injuries.  In Brooklyn, high winds combined with high astronomical tides drove water from New York Harbor over retaining walls that flooded parts of the Belt Parkway near the Verrazano Bridge.  In Rockland County, wind blew off part of the roof at Suffern Middle School.

Here are selected specific peak wind gusts for:

Orange County - The peak measured wind gust reported by a spotter in Warwick was 64 mph.  Peak wind gusts measured by the Automated Surface Observing Systems at Stewart Field Airport in Newburgh was 53 mph at 8:45 am and at Montgomery Airport was 50 mph at 9:58 am.

A low pressure system rapidly intensified and moved north along the mid Atlantic coast during Saturday December 30th. This produced a wide swath of heavy snow to the northwest of the storm track. Snowfall began between 5 and 7 AM across the area, and fell at intense rates right from the start. Snowfall rates of one to two inches per hour were common. There were also numerous reports of thunder and lightning accompanying the most intense snow bands. Winds also began to increase later Saturday morning, causing some blowing and drifting of snow, which reduced visibilities significantly, and created near blizzard conditions at times in some areas. 

As the low pressure center approached the south shore of Suffolk county early Saturday afternoon, milder air from the Atlantic Ocean wrapped into the storm system, and changed the heavy snow to a mixture of sleet and rain across eastern Suffolk county. This limited snowfall amounts somewhat across eastern Suffolk County.

The low pressure center crossed central Suffolk County during mid afternoon on Saturday, before moving northeast into southern New England later that evening. As the low moved away, the precipitation tapered off across the area. Subfreezing temperatures and gusty winds lingered behind the storm system.

Here are some specific snowfall totals from this storm system:

Orange County: 14 inches at Harriman, to 21 inches at Warwick and Rock Tavern.

Putnam County: 13 inches at Carmel and Brewster.

Rockland County: 15 inches at Airmont, to 18 inches at Suffern.

A low pressure system developed off the mid Atlantic coast Saturday afternoon and moved northeast, passing east of Long Island early Sunday.  With abundant low level moisture and cold air in place, light intermittent precipitation occurred Saturday.  As the low intensified, heavy precipitation developed and moved northeast across the area. 

Heavy snow occurred across Orange, Putnam, Rockland, and northern Westchester counties. 

In the New York City area, southern Westchester County, and across Nassau County, a period of sleet and freezing rain occurred Saturday night, producing ice accumulations of up to 0.20 inches.  This buildup of ice on major highways and bridges produced hazardous travel conditions Saturday night, and contributed to an airplane skidding off the runway at JFK Airport Sunday morning. The sleet and freezing rain changed to heavy snow early Sunday morning. 
 
Across Suffolk County, a significant period of sleet and freezing rain occurred Saturday night, before changing to heavy snow early Sunday morning.  Ice accumulations ranged from 0.25 to 0.50 inches.  This accretion of ice on tree limbs caused some tree branches to fall, and led to power outages. 

Here are some specific snowfall and ice amounts for:

Orange County:  from 5 inches at Newburgh to 7 inches measured at Chester.

On Thursday February 22, a low pressure system over the southeast U. S. quickly moved northeast off the mid Atlantic coast by Thursday evening. Well north of this storm system, an overrunning pattern of mild, moist air over a pre-existing cold air mass allowed for a large area of moderate snow to develop and spread northeast into southeast New York during the afternoon hours. Although the event was relatively brief in duration, snowfall rates of one to two inches per hour were common. This created hazardous traveling conditions for the Thursday evening commute across the New York City metropolitan area and Long Island, resulting in numerous minor traffic accidents.

As the low pressure system continued moving out to sea, the snow tapered off from west to east during Thursday night.

Here are some specific snowfall amounts for this snow event:

For Orange County: 3 inches at Middletown, to 6.5 inches at Rock Tavern.

A complex and slow-moving coastal storm affected much of southeast New York and Long Island from Sunday March 4th through the early morning hours of Wednesday March 7th. This storm was accompanied by a mixture of snow, sleet, freezing rain and rain through the early portion of the event, and mainly heavy snow for the remainder of the event. Gusty winds and minor to moderate coastal flooding and beach erosion also occurred along coastal portions of Long Island.

On Sunday March 4th, a strong low pressure system moved east across the Tennessee Valley, while a new low slowly developed off the Mid Atlantic coast. The precipitation shield accompanying this complex storm system moved north and reached southeast New York in the form of spotty light snow and sleet by Sunday afternoon. The precipitation intensified Sunday night and early Monday, but as warmer air moved into the region aloft, the snow changed to a mixture of sleet, freezing rain and rain by Monday morning along coastal sections. Some portions of interior southeast New York received several inches of snow from this initial surge of precipitation.

During Monday March 5th, the new low pressure system off the Mid Atlantic coast began to intensify rapidly. This spread heavy precipitation across eastern Long Island from the east by Monday afternoon and evening. As colder air was drawn into the storm's circulation, the precipitation changed to heavy wet snow by Monday evening across eastern Long Island. Snowfall rates of two to three inches per hour for at least 3 hours were common across most of Suffolk County through the early portion of Monday night. This heavier snow also began to move west, spreading across western Long Island and the New York City area later Monday night into Tuesday.

Bands of moderate to heavy wet snow continued into Tuesday across much of southeast New York, extending back into interior sections as the low slowly drifted north off the eastern end of Long Island. This coastal low then became nearly stationary during Tuesday, and even retrograded slightly to the southwest during Tuesday afternoon. This prolonged the  periods of moderate to heavy wet snow across most of southeast New York into the late afternoon hours on Tuesday. The storm finally began to retreat east off the New Jersey coast Tuesday night and Wednesday, allowing the snow to taper off and end by early Wednesday morning on March 7th.

The combination of very heavy wet snow and strong winds with this prolonged coastal storm produced scattered power outages across southeast New York, primarily across Suffolk County. In addition, many schools and businesses were closed for several days due to the hazardous nature of this storm. 

Here are some storm total snowfall amounts:

For Orange County: 6 inches at Middletown, to 13 inches at Monroe and Tuxedo Park.

For Putnam County: 6 inches at Carmel, to 14 inches at Mahopac.

For Rockland County: 4.5 inches at Valley Cottage, to 7.6 inches at Stony Point.

A strong and slow-moving coastal storm produced widespread heavy rain and strong gusty winds throughout southeast New York from Wednesday March 21st through Thursday March 22nd. A tight pressure gradient between the intensifying low pressure system off the mid Atlantic coast and a strong high pressure system over the Canadian Maritimes produced wind gusts between 40 and 50 mph from Wednesday afternoon into early Thursday morning. These strong wind gusts caused several buildings in Manhattan to lose scaffolding and broke some windows. On Long Island and other portions of southeast New York, strong winds combined with nearly saturated ground from heavy rainfall, caused trees to fall onto power lines, and resulted in scattered power outages.  

In addition to the strong gusty winds, heavy rainfall also occurred during this storm. Across the lower Hudson Valley, one to two inches of rain were common. Two to three inches of rain were common with this storm across New York City and Long Island, with some localized amounts reaching 4 inches. This triggered urban flooding in several areas, and created hazardous driving conditions for the Wednesday evening commute and the Thursday morning commute across the New York City metropolitan area.

A low pressure system moved northeast along the mid Atlantic coast and produced widespread heavy rain across the New York City metropolitan area and Long Island beginning late Thursday night March 29th and ending by Friday evening March 30th. The low developed over the southeast states Thursday afternoon, and moved northeast to a position near Washington D.C. by early Friday morning. The low then continued moving northeast, passing across eastern Long Island early Friday afternoon, and off the New England coast by late Friday night. Strong "overrunning" of warm, moist air over a pre-existing colder airmass, combined with a strong easterly wind flow of moisture-laden air off the Atlantic Ocean, produced very heavy rainfall across New York City and Long Island during the daytime hours on Friday. Two to three inches of rain were common across much of southeast New York, with some localized amounts up to four inches, particularly across portions of Nassau and Suffolk counties. This created widespread urban and highway flooding during the Friday morning commute, which continued into the early afternoon hours.

On Sunday, June 17th, abundant moisture from the remnants of tropical storm Allison, combined with a cold front approaching from the west, produced extremely heavy rainfall across much of southeast New York during the early morning hours.  Rainfall rates of up to 3 inches per hour produced widespread street and highway flooding, in addition to some flash flooding of small streams.  Some rivers approached or even slightly exceeded flood stage during this heavy rain event.

Heavy rain first affected portions of Rockland and Westchester Counties between 3:30 AM and 6 AM EDT.  The area of heavy rain then slowly shifted east, across New York City around mid morning through midday, Nassau and western Suffolk Counties from late morning through early afternoon, and across central and eastern Suffolk County during the early to mid afternoon hours.  

In Rockland County, the Mahwah River at Suffern crested at 3.79 feet at 10:15 AM EDT, remaining just below its' flood stage of 4.0 feet. However, widespread flooding of streets occurred during the morning hours in Rockland County, closing several major roads which became impassable due to the excessive rainfall.  Several houses were also evacuated due to flooding conditions, particularly near Valley Cottage.

Excessive rainfall also led to severe flooding conditions across portions of Westchester County.  In Greenburgh, 23 residential structures experienced basement flooding, causing thousands of dollars of property damage in the Babbitt Court area.  In Ossining, the Sparta Brook overflowed its' banks around 5 AM EDT, washing away a backyard and flooding an adjoining basement and garage.  Flooding also was reported in Mt. Kisco, particularly near Shoppers Park, where several stores reported damage from the flooding.  Damage to several municipal buildings was also reported in other portions of downtown Mt. Kisco.   

There were also numerous reports of street and highway flooding in the New York City area, as well as Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island, which led to several major road and highway closings.

High winds downed many trees, which fell on  houses, uprooted sidewalks, and downed power lines in a 15 to 20 block area.  This storm also downed trees and power lines in Mamaroneck. Torrential rain also caused flooding of low-lying and poor drainage areas.

Heavy rains caused widespread significant ponding of water in poor drainage and low-lying areas in the New York City area.  In Staten Island, several cars became inundated with water and stalled.  Several people required rescue from their cars.  In Manhattan, flooding caused the closure of a large segment of West Side highway between 100th and 120th Streets.

These heavy rains also led to rises in area rivers and streams. In Rockland County, the Mahwah River at Suffern was above its' flood stage of 4.0 ft. from 4:56 PM EDT on June 23rd until 3:42 AM EDT on June 24th.

A wetter pattern developed during late March that lasted through May.  The tri-state region saw drought conditions relax a bit due to some very beneficial rains and some diligent water use restrictions and conservation measures.  May broke a string of 10 consecutive months of below normal precipitation.  The Hydrologic Service Area (HSA) received 4.77 inches for the month, which was 122 percent of normal or 0.85 inches above normal.  Sixteen of the past 20 months, dating back to October 2000, were below normal.  The total precipitation deficit during the past 20 months was 17.71 inches; and during the past 11 months was 14.26 inches.

Despite the recent rainfall, ground water levels were similar to levels during the 1965-66 drought.  Ground water storage was much less than in normal years.  However, surface water storage did improve.

The combined storage in the New York City reservoir system at the end of May was 77.0 percent capacity, which was 20.0 percent below normal.  Capacities in the individual reservoirs at the end of May were:

As a cold high pressure system settled over New England, a series of low pressure systems developed off the Mid Atlantic Coast during Friday, December 5th and Saturday, December 6th.

The first low pressure system developed along the North Carolina Coast during Friday morning.  As this low moved northeast, it intensified.  Light snow developed and quickly spread northeast across the area during the morning.  Snowfall became heavy across the NYC Metro Area, Long Island, and Southern Westchester County during the afternoon. Between 7 and 10 pm that evening, a 6 to 10 inch snowfall occurred across this area.  There were major impacts to mass transit operations during the evening's "rush" hours.  As this low moved southeast of Long Island, snowfall intensity decreased and became light across the region.

The second low pressure system developed further north and west along the DELMARVA Coast during Saturday morning.  As this low rapidly intensified, it moved slowly northeast.  Light snow became heavy across the entire region by early afternoon.  Blizzard conditions developed from Queens County east across Suffolk County between 1 pm and 6 pm.  Wind gusts of at least 35 mph combined with heavy falling snow created "white out" conditions that reduced visibility to less than 1/4 mile.  Major widespread impacts to mass transit occurred across the entire region.

Storm Total Snowfall amounts for this 2 day episode ranged from 6 to 25 inches.  Most snowfall accumulations were between 10 and 15 inches.  Here are selected snowfall amounts for:

New York County - from 14.0 inches at Central Park Zoo to 17.8 inches at Bryant Park.

An arctic cold front swept southeast across the region during Tuesday afternoon, January 13th.  Extremely cold air followed this front through Wednesday, January 14th.

As an Alberta Clipper passed south of Long Island Wednesday night, it rapidly intensified as it moved northeast of Long Island Thursday.  The large difference in pressure between a strong low pressure system northeast of New England and a strong arctic high pressure system in Southeast Canada resulted in the combination of extremely low temperatures, high winds, and extremely low wind chill index values from sunset Thursday evening through sunrise Friday morning, January 16th.

Record low temperatures were set and tied on the following dates:

On January 15th:
A record low temperature of 2 degrees above 0 was set at John F. Kennedy Airport.
A record low temperature of 1 degree above 0 was set at Islip Airport.

On January 16th:

A cold high pressure ridge extended southeast from James Bay across New England.  As the primary low moved northeast toward the Eastern Great Lakes, a secondary low developed off the Mid Atlantic Coast during Tuesday morning, January 27th.  This secondary low rapidly intensified as it moved northeast.

A light mixture of snow, sleet, and freezing rain spread north across the area during Tuesday afternoon.  A light coating of ice on area roads made traveling extremely hazardous toward evening.  Many traffic accidents occurred across the NYC Metropolitan Area during this time.  As the precipitation rate increased during the evening, the mixture changed to a steady snow, which became heavy at times.  Most Storm Total Snowfall amounts ranged from around 6 to 12 inches.

The peak of this surge occurred Monday Night as Sandy made landfall in Southern New Jersey, with widespread record coastal flooding occurring in Lower New York Harbor exceeding the FEMA 100 year base flood elevations. Peak storm tides surpassed all previously documented high water marks, including the October 31, 1991 and December 11, 1992 nor'easters and the recorded peaks from Hurricane Irene in 2011 and Hurricane Donna in 1960.||The record storm tide levels along the south shore of New York City resulted from a peak storm surge of about 8 to 10 feet that coincided with normal high tides. These storm tides resulted in up to 3 to 6 feet of inundation along the south shore of Manhattan, with up to 2 to 4 feet of inundation along the East River and Hudson River neighborhoods.||Two fatalities were attributed to the storm surge in Manhattan.","Post Tropical Storm Sandy was the costliest natural disaster in Southeast New York.||Tropical Storm Sandy formed in the Caribbean Sea on October 22. After drifting slowly southwest on October 23, Sandy turned to the north and intensified to a hurricane on October 24, just before making landfall in Jamaica. Hurricane Sandy continued to the north and intensified to a strong category two hurricane before making landfall again in Cuba shortly after Midnight EDT on the 25th. Hurricane Sandy emerged on the other side of Cuba during the morning of the 25th and proceeded to drift northwest as a category one or two hurricane as it moved through the Bahamas on the 25th and 26th. Overnight on the 26th, Hurricane Sandy (Category 1) started to move toward the north northeast, a motion that continued into the evening of the 28th. From there, Sandy���s motion became driven by two factors. An anomalously strong blocking ridge over the Canadian Maritimes prevented Sandy from escaping to the east. Simultaneously, an approaching and deepening extratropical trough was about to capture Sandy. The combination of the two, turned Sandy to the north overnight on the 28th and then to the northwest on the 29th.||As Sandy continued to move northwest and interact with the mid latitude trough, its interaction continued to make it less tropical, but did not weaken it much. Sandy continued to make a harder turn to the left (west) and made landfall in Atlantic County as a post tropical storm in Brigantine City just north of Atlantic City at 7:30 p.m. EDT on the 29th. The estimated minimum central pressure was 945 millibars. The lowest recorded central pressure was 945.6 millibars at the Atlantic City Marina at 7:34 p.m. EDT.||Record breaking high tides and wave action was combined with sustained winds of 40 to 60 mph and wind gusts of 80 to 90 mph.||These extreme conditions resulted in at least 60 deaths and widespread property damage of at least 42 billion dollars.||Emergency managers recommended mandatory evacuations of more than 1/2 million people that lived in low lying areas.
